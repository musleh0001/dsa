### What is Data Structure?
> A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively.

### What is Algorithm?
> Algorithm is defined as a process or set of well-defined instructions that are typically used to solve a particular group of problem or perform a specific type of calculation.

### Complexities
> * **Time complexity:** Time complexity is used to measure the amount of time required to execute the code.
> * **Space complexity:** Space complexity means the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities of the code.

#### What is Array?
> Array is a linear data structure that is collection of similar data types. Arrays are stored is contiguous memory locations
